## Rules of the game

1. The Button bets the **Small Blind** (SB) of 1🟡. The other player bets the **Big Blind** of 2🟡.
    
2. Each player is delt a face-down card that only they can see. 
    
3. Now, the (first and only) betting round starts. The Bet Size must be a power of 2, and no bigger than ==32 , the **Bet Limit**==. So, the SB may: 
	- Fold (f), 
	- Call (c, 2🟡), 
	- Raise (R, 4🟡), 
	- Double Raise (D, 8🟡), 
	- Triple Raise (T, 16🟡) or 
	- Quadruple Raise (Q, 32🟡).
    
4. If one player fords, the other wins the pot. Otherwise, when they both players acted, and both bets are the same amount, we proceed to **Showdown**. First to show is the BB. [^1]
    
5. The highest card wins the pot! [^2]
     
6. Move the Button to the other player, and repeat!
