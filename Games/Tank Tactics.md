## **Tank Tactics — Core Rules**


### **Objective**

Be the **last surviving player** by the end of the game. 

---

### **Setup**

- Every player starts at a **random position** on a grid.
    
- Each player begins with:
    
    - **3 hearts** ❤️❤️❤️ (health points)
        
    - **1 action points ⚡️ (AP)** 

---

### **Turn Timing & Action Points**

- Once every **24 hours**, each player receives **1 AP** ⚡️.
    
- **Action points are public**

---

### **Actions**


At any time (whenever you have enough AP), you can expend AP to perform one of these:
1. **Move** 🏃 — move to an _adjacent, unoccupied_ square  
    → Costs **1 AP**
    
2. **Shoot another player** 🔫 — provided they are within your range  
    → Costs **1 AP**  
    → Inflicts **1 heart damage** on the target 
    
3. **Gift 1 AP** 🎁
    → Costs **1 AP**  
    → The target player receives +1 AP
    
4. **Add a heart to yourself** 💚 (heal)  
    → Costs **2 AP**
    
5. **Upgrade your tank!** 🆙
    → Costs **3 AP**  
    → **+1 shooting/trading range** (starting from 2 squares)
    → **+1 hearts limit** (starting from 3 hearts)

---

### **Range, Gifts, and Revival**

- You can **send gifts** to other players within your current range:
    
    - Hearts
        
    - Action points
        
- A player reduced to **0 hearts is “dead”** (downed):
    
    - **Stealing**: Their remaining AP goes to the player who dealt the fatal blow.
        
    - Dead players remain on the grid (they are _not removed_). 
        
- **Revival:** Dead players can be revived if another player **gifts them a heart**; they come back with **1 heart and 0 AP**. 

---

### **Jury System**

- All dead players form a **jury**.
    
- Each player **votes** for a **tank**. That tank will receive an **extra daily +1 AP**. The vote may be changed at any time.

---

### **Item Spawns**

- Once per day, a **random item** *may* spawn at a random location on the map. The first player to reach that square picks it up and gains the bonus. 
     
     - 💚 heal +1 heart
       
     - ❤️ increase +1 maximum hearts
       
     - 🏹 max range increased by +1

---

### **Winning**

- The game ends when only **one living player remains**.
    
- At any point, the remaining players may **agree upon an order** (1st, 2nd, 3rd, ...) and end the game.

## The game in practice

The players will participate in a dedicated **Telegram chat**. We will meet **once a day**, when all the living players are available. Players will submit the actions, and the *Game Master* will execute the actions in order.

At the beginning of the meeting, every live tank gets +1 AP, and the player actions are discussed by voice. To settle priority disputes, we shall rely on the group chat, standing by the motto: *"First come, first served!"*
