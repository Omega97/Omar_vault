# **Masterworks: Rules Summary**

---

## Objective  

Compete as gallery owners to collect the most valuable hidden art collection. Use bluffing, trading, and speculation to maximize your endgame score.

---

## Setup

- Each player starts with:
    
    - 3 Painting Lots (fixed)
        
    - 30 Coins ($30M)
        
- Shuffle 52-card deck (no Jokers)
    
- Each player Scouts:
    
    - Draw 2 cards: choose 1 to Vault (face-down Painting), discard the other (face-up Frame)
        
    - Stack Frame visibly on top of Painting
        
- Remaining cards form the Gallery Deck
    

---

**Key Terms:**

- **Painting**: Hidden (face-down) card
    
- **Frame**: Visible (face-up) card stacked above Painting
    
- **Lot**: One of 3 display slots
    
- **Vault**: Hidden area to protect Paintings (placed horizontally)
    

---

## Round Structure

Each round has two phases:

1. **Curation Phase** (each player, in turn):
    
    - Scout (-10 coins)
        
    - Exposition (earn coins)
        
    - Hide / Exhibit (move Paintings to/from Vault)
        
    - Steal (1d6 to steal; defender may block with a 6)
        
    - Appraise (-5 coins to peek at opponent's Painting)
        
2. **Market Phase** (each player may):
    
    - Auction a Painting
        
    - Negotiate a trade
        
    - Sell a Set to the Bank
        

---

## Action Costs

- Scout: -10 coins
    
- Appraise: -5 coins
    
- All other actions: Free
    

---

## Exposition Revenue

- 2–9 = 1 coin
    
- 10 = 2 coins
    
- J/Q/K = 2 coins
    
- A = 3 coins
    
- +1 bonus coin if the Painting was bought from another player
    

---

## Heist Rules

- Target only exposed Paintings unless all are Vaulted
    
- Roll 1d6:
    
    - 6 = success (steal into Vault)
        
    - Defender rolls 6 = block
        

---

## Special Sets

- 3 cards (either Frame or Paintings) that:
    
    - Have same number, or
        
    - Are 3 consecutive same-suit cards
        
- Exposing the final card of a Set triggers immediate, doubled Exposition
    
- Selling to Bank earns coins equal to total point value
    

---

## Vault Mechanics

- Cards are safe from Stealing
    
- Placed horizontally, face-down
    
- Can be Exhibited back to Lots
    
- Cards in Vault are eligible for Set bonuses at endgame
    

---

## Game End

- When Gallery Deck is exhausted, complete current round
    

---

## Final Scoring

- Paintings (hidden + Frames):
    
    - 2–10 = face value
        
    - J/Q/K = 15 points
        
    - A = 20 points
        
- Coins = 1 point each
    
- Sets double value of included cards (only one Set per card)
    
- Most Paintings bought: +10 pts
    
- Most total Paintings (Frames + Paintings): split 12 pts
    
- Ties: Most Vaulted Masterpieces wins
