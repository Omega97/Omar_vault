# **Royal Gambit**  
*A Push-Your-Luck Card Game of Courtly Intrigue*  

---

## 🎯 **Goal**  
The players flip cards face-up on the table - one at the time - to get points. If you flip two of the same rank, you go bust.
At the end of a hand, if a player got to 30+ points, there is one more hand, where everybody plays, except the favorite(s). After that, if there is a tie for first, the tied players keep playing until one wins.

## 🃏 **Components**  
- 1 standard 52-card French deck (no Jokers)

## 🧾 **Card Values & Roles**  

| Rank            | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ace**         | **+1 Points**<br>*A humble petition to the throne*                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **2, 3, 4, 5**  | **Face value points**<br>*Favor from minor nobles*                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **6, 8, 9, 10** | *Empty courtesies—polite but worthless*<br>(Optionally, the **10 blocks the Jacks**)                                                                                                                                         |
| 7               | **"Hot Potato"**: Immediately when flipped, choose another player still in the hand that does not have a face-up 7; **give it to them** (otherwise, you keep it). (You still bust if you already have a 7 when you draw one) |
| **Jack (J)**    | **Court Spy**: Immediately when flipped, choose a player still in the hand (yes, even yourself); they immediately **flip TWO cards**.                                                                                        |
| **Queen (Q)**   | **Royal Pardon**: If you ever flip a second card of the same rank (bust), the Queen **automatically cancels the bust**. Flip face-down (or discard) the Queen and the duplicate card.                                        |
| **King (K)**    | **Crown’s Blessing**: If you stay without busting, your total score for the hand is **doubled**.                                                                                                                             |

> 💡 **Note**: All cards count toward the **bust condition**, including face cards. Flip two Jacks? You’re exposed. Two Kings? The Crown turns on you. Bust = 0 points (unless saved by a Queen).
> 💡 **Note**: The effect of the Queen is resolved before the effect of the other action cards. If you flip an action card while resolving an other action card, you start immediately resolving the new card.

## 🔄 **Gameplay**  

### **Setup**  
- Shuffle the deck.  
- Agree on the target score (**30 points** is recommended).  

### **On Your Turn**  
During your turn you can HIT or STAY.

1. **HIT**: Flip the top card of the deck and place it face-up in front of you.  
   - Immediately apply its effect (e.g., Jack forces another player to flip 2; give the 7 to an other player).  
   - **Check for bust**: If any two cards share the same rank, you bust; flip your cards face-down, score = 0 (unless a Queen saves you).  
   - If saved by a Queen, flip face-down only the Queen and the duplicate, then continue. 
   - (Optionally, when someone has 0 points on the table, since they have nothing to lose, the dealer may automatically *hit* without them asking)

1. **STAY**: End your turn.  
   - Calculate your score: sum Ace–5 values → apply King bonus (×2 max).  
   - Add to your total score.  
   - You may rearrange all you cards on a single pile.

3. **End of Hand**:  
   - Return all flipped cards to the deck.  
   - **Shuffle the entire deck** before the next player’s turn.  

### **Turn Order**  
Players take turns **sequentially**, clockwise.

## 🏁 **Ending the Game**  
- At the end of a hand, if a player got to 30+ points, there is one more hand, where everybody plays, except the favorite(s). 
- After that, the player with most points wins. 
- If there is a tie for first, the tied players keep playing until one wins.

## 💬 **Thematic Flavor**
> *"In the gilded halls of the palace, every whisper could be your fortune—or your ruin. Will you press your luck for the King’s favor, or retreat before scandal strikes? Remember: two of the same secret, and the guards will drag you to the dungeons."*

## ℹ️ **Design Notes**  
- **Bust probability rises quickly**: With 13 ranks and 4 copies each, flipping 5+ cards is risky.  
- **Face cards add drama, not dominance**: Their powers are situational and balanced.  
- **Fast rounds**: Reshuffling every hand keeps the game unpredictable and snappy (~10–15 seconds per turn).

**Play time**: 15–20 minutes  
**Players**: 2–5  
**Ages**: 10+  

*May the court smile upon you.*
