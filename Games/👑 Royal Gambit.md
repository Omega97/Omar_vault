# **Royal Gambit - "Guazzabuglio**"

_A Push-Your-Luck Card Game of Courtly Intrigue_

---

## 🎯 **Goal**

Flip cards to accumulate points. If you *stay*, count your points, and add them to your total. You go "bust" if you flip any two **numbered** cards of the **same rank** (not the figures). Play until a player reaches **40 or more points** at the end of a hand. After the target is reached, one final round is played where everyone except the current *leader(s)* gets one last turn — the "Catch-up" — to try to overtake them.

---

## 🃏 **Components**

- 1 standard 52-card French deck (no Jokers)
    
- Pen and paper (or chips) to count the points

## 🔄 **Gameplay**

Play hands until a player reaches **40 points**.

On your turn, you may **HIT** or **STAY**.

1. **HIT**: Flip the top card of the deck.
    
    - **Apply Effects**: Resolve the card immediately (e.g., passing an 8, or a Jack forcing 2 more flips). If a Jack forces a flip that reveals _another_ Jack, the effect stacks.
        
    - **Check for Bust**: If you have two **numbered** cards of the same rank (A–10), you bust and score 0 for the turn.
    
2. **STAY**: End your turn and calculate your score.
    
    - **Base Score**: Sum of Ace through 5.
        
    - **Multiplier**: Apply King bonus to the base score ($Base \times (1 + \text{Number of Kings})$).
        
    - **Bonus**: Add +5 for each set you collected.
        
    - **Max Score**: The maximum possible score in a single hand is $(15 \times 5) + (5 \times 3) = 90$

When any player reaches 40 points, everyone except for the current *leader(s)* plays **one last hand** — the "Catch-up" hand — to try to overtake him. If there is still more than one *leader*, they play hands until a draw is reached.

## 🏁 **Ending the Game**

- **The Final Round**: Once a player reaches **40+ points**, they become the "Favorite." One final hand is played where every other player attempts to beat that score. The Favorite does not play in this final round.
    
- **Winning**: After the final round, the player with the highest total score wins.
    
- **The Duel**: If there is a tie for first place, the tied players play "Sudden Death" hands until one person ends a turn with a higher score.
