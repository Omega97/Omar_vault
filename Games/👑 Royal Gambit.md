## 🎯 **Goal**

*Flip* cards to accumulate points. If you *stay*, count your points, and add them to your total. You go *bust* if you flip any two **numbered** cards of the **same rank** (not the figures). 
**If you are ahead**, you may decide to *stay* instead. Now it's up to other players to catch up, and collect more points than you. At the end of the hand, the player with most points **wins**.

## 🃏 **Components**

- 1 standard 52-card *French* deck (no Jokers)
    
- Pen and paper (or chips) to count the points at the end of the hand

## 🧾 **Card Values & Effects**

Some cards that are face-up on your side of the table give you points. Other cards give you bonus effects when you flip them.

| **Rank**  | **Points**                                                                                                                                    |

| **7**     | **Lucky Seven 🍀**: Target a player\*; they have to **give you a card** of **their** choice (remember, you can't have double numbered cards). |
| **8**     | **Hot Potato**🥔: Target a player\* who does NOT have a face-up 8; **give them this card**.                                                   |
| 9         | *brick*                                                                                                                                       |

| **Queen** | **Extra Life** ♥️: If you go bust, you can **cover a Queen** **and the last card you flipped**, and keep playing                              |
| **King**  | **Double Points** 🔵🔵👑: Every King is worth **as many points as you get from your numbered cards.**                                         |

\**You may target only players that are still in the hand.*
_Note: Effects activate only when **flipping** a card._
\*\*_You may have to target yourself. If you flip a Jack, first check if you are busted. If you are not, action-cards you flip may be resolved in any order of choice_

### 👑 **Sets**

For each set you manage to complete, you will be rewarded with extra points (if you don't bust).

| Set               | Cards         | Points |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| **Royal Family**  | J, Q, K       | +5     |
| **High Straight** | 6, 7, 8, 9, T | +5     |
| **Low Straight**  | A, 2, 3, 4, 5 | +5     |

\**The King doesn't double the points from the sets.*

## 🔄 **Gameplay**

On your turn, you may **HIT** or **STAY**.

1. **HIT**: Flip the top card of the deck.
    
    - **Apply Effects**: Resolve the card immediately (e.g., passing an 8, or a Jack forcing 2 more flips). If a Jack forces a flip that reveals _another_ Jack, the effect stacks.
        
    - **Check for Bust**: If you have two **numbered** cards of the same rank (A–10), you bust and score 0 for the turn.
    
2. **STAY**: End your turn and calculate your score.
    
    - **Base Score**: Sum of Ace through 5.
        
    - **Multiplier**: Apply King bonus to the base score ($Base \times (1 + \text{Number of Kings})$).
        
    - **Bonus**: Add +5 for each set you collected.
        
    - **Max Score**: The maximum possible score in a single hand is $(15 \times 5) + (5 \times 3) = 90$

The player with **most points** **wins the hand**.

## 🏁 **Ending the Game**

- **Winning the HAND**: After all players *stayed* or have *busted*, the player with most points **wins the hand**.
    
- **Winning the GAME**: You may decide to count **how many hands** each player won, or **how many points** the winner collected. After a **set number of hands**, the player with most points **wins the game**
