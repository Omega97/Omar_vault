## 🎯 **Goal**

*Flip* cards one at the time to accumulate points. If you *stay*, count your points, and add them to your total. You go *bust* if you flip any two **numbered** cards of the **same rank** (not the figures). 
**If you are ahead**, you may decide to *stay* instead. Now it's up to other players to catch up, and collect more points than you. At the end of the hand, the player with most points **wins**.

| Rank  | Effect                                                                                                                            |
| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 6     | *brick*                                                                                                                           |
| **7** | **Lucky Seven 🍀**: Target a player\*; they have to **give you a card** of **their** choice (but you can't make them go *bust*!). |
| **8** | **Hot Potato**🥔: Target a player\* who does NOT have a face-up 8; **give them this card**.                                       |
| 9     | *brick*                                                                                                                           |
| T     | *brick*                                                                                                                           |

#### The Royal Family 👑

You don't go *bust* with them. They are the most powerful cards in the game.

| Rank      | Effect                                                                                                           |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Jack**  | **The Sniper** 🔫: Target a player\* to **flip TWO cards SIMULTANEOUSLY**\*\*                                    |
| **Queen** | **Extra Life** ♥️: If you go bust, you can **cover a Queen** **and the last card you flipped**, and keep playing |
| **King**  | **Double Points** 🔵🔵👑: Every King is worth **as many points as you get from your _pointed cards_.**           |


#### The Joker

You don't go *bust* with Jokers. They help you complete *sets* to get extra points (check out the next section). 

| Rank         | Effect                                 |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Joker** 🤡 | Use it to complete one of your *sets*. |


\**You may target only players that are still in the hand.*
_Note: Effects activate only when **flipping** a card._
\*\*_You may have to target yourself. If you flip a Jack, first check if you are busted. If you are not, action-cards you flip may be resolved in any order of choice_

---

### **Sets** 🍱

For each set you manage to complete, you will be rewarded with extra points (if you don't bust).

| Set               | Cards         | Points |
| ----------------- | ------------- | ------ |
| **Royal Family**  | J, Q, K       | +5     |
| **High Straight** | 6, 7, 8, 9, T | +5     |
| **Low Straight**  | A, 2, 3, 4, 5 | +5     |

\**The King doesn't double the points from the sets.*

---

## 🔄 **Gameplay**

On your turn, you may **HIT** or **STAY**.

1. **HIT**: Flip the top card of the deck.
    
    - **Apply Effects**: Resolve the card immediately (e.g., passing an 8, or a Jack forcing 2 more flips). If a Jack forces a flip that reveals _another_ Jack, the effect stacks.
        
    - **Check for Bust**: If you have two **numbered** cards of the same rank (A–10), you bust and score 0 for the turn.
    
2. **STAY**: If you are the point leader, you can decide to *stay*, end your turn, and calculate your score.

The player with **most points** **wins the hand**.

---

### **Going Bust 💥**

You **Bust** the moment you have **two numbered cards of the same rank** (Ace through 10) face-up on your side of the table.

- **The Safe Cards:** Only numbered cards (A–10) cause a bust. The figures—**Jacks, Queens, and Kings**—are "Royal" and safe; you can collect as many of them as you like without ever risking a bust.
    
- **The Penalty:** When you bust, your turn ends immediately and you score **0 points** for the hand.
    
- **Extra Life:** The **Queen** is your only protection against disaster. If you flip a duplicate card while you have a Queen face-up, cover the Queen and the duplicate card you just flipped, and keep playing.

## 🏁 **Ending the Game**

- **Winning the HAND**: After all players *stayed* or have *busted*, the player with most points **wins the hand**.
    
- **_Cappotto_**: if everyone else *busted*, you win the hand, even with 0 points. 
    
- **Winning the GAME**: You may decide on a **set number of wins**. For example, the first player to win **3** hands, **wins the game**.
