# **Monopoly – Strategic Auction Start Variant**


## 🎯 Objective

Reduce starting-order randomness and introduce early strategic depth through a structured auction phase.

---

## 1️⃣ Setup

1. Set up the board and distribute starting money as usual.
    
2. Shuffle the property title deed deck.
    
3. Each player is dealt **one random property** for free.
    
    - The player immediately receives its Title Deed.
        
    - No payment is required.
        
    - Railroads and Utilities are included.
        
    - Chance/Community Chest cards are excluded.

## 2️⃣ Auction Phase

1. Draw **one additional random property per player** from the remaining deck.
    
2. Reveal all drawn properties.
    
3. Sort them by **increasing printed purchase price**.
    
4. Auction them **in that order**.

### Auction Rules

- Open ascending auction.
    
- **Minimum bid = 50% of the printed property price** (rounded up if needed).
    
- Bidding increases in standard Monopoly increments.
    
- The highest bidder:
    
    - Pays the bid amount to the bank.
        
    - Receives the property.
        
- If no player bids at the minimum price:
    
    - The property is discarded and returned to the bottom of the deck.

## 3️⃣ Determining Turn Order

After the auction phase:

1. Each player calculates the **total printed value** of the properties they own.
    
2. Players are ranked from **lowest total value to highest total value**.
    
3. The player with the **lowest total property value goes first**.
    
4. Ties are broken by:
    
    - Fewest properties.
        
    - If still tied, random draw.

No dice roll is used to determine turn order.

## 4️⃣ Begin Standard Play

After turn order is set, the game proceeds exactly as **standard Monopoly** rules.

# 🔎 Design Intent

This variant:

- Introduces early capital allocation strategy.
    
- Reduces pure first-mover randomness.
    
- Creates meaningful tradeoffs between asset strength and turn position.
    
- Accelerates midgame structure formation.
