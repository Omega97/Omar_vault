# **President: Revolution Edition**  
*A Fast-Paced Climbing Card Game for 4–8 Players*  

---

### **Objective**  
Be the first to play all the cards in your hand. The order in which players go out determines their title for the next round—and earns points toward victory. The first player to reach an **agreed-upon number of points** (like 10) wins the game.

---

### **Components**  
- Two standard 52-card French decks + Jokers (optional but recommended)  

> *Note: With two decks, duplicate cards (e.g., two Ace of Spades) are allowed and can be played together as pairs, triples, etc.*

---

### **Setup**  
1. Shuffle both decks (including Jokers) into one pile.  
2. Deal **exactly 9 cards** to each player. Set aside any leftover cards—they are not used.  
3. Players look at their hands in secret.

### **Card Rankings & Play Hierarchy**  

#### **A. Rank Order (Normal Mode)**  
Cards rank from low to high as:  
**3 < 4 < ... < 10 < J < Q < K < A < 2**  
Jokers are **wild**—they can substitute for any card in a set and rank just above 2s.

> *Note: A single Joker doesn't beat a single 2.*

#### **B. Multi-Card Hierarchy**  
Plays are ranked **first by quantity**, then by card rank:  
- Any **pair** beats any single  
- Any **triple** beats any pair  
- Any **quad** (*Revolution*, **highest possible combination**) beats any triple 

So the full sequence of playable strengths is:  
**3 < … < 2 < 33 < … < 22 < 333 < … < 222 < 3333 < … < 2222**

> *Example: 555 (triple 5s) beats KK (pair of Kings), even though K > 5.*

#### **C. Revolution Rule**  
If a player plays **four cards of the same rank** (e.g., four 7s), a **Revolution** occurs immediately:
- The card ranking **reverses**:  
  **2 < A < K < … < 4 < 3** (3 becomes highest, 2 lowest)  
- Jokers remain wild and rank above 3 in Revolution mode.  
- The current trick ends instantly. The player who triggered the Revolution leads the next trick.  
- Each subsequent quad flips the hierarchy back and forth.

> *Tip: Save quads for moments when you hold many low cards—they become powerful!*

### **Gameplay**  

#### **Starting the First Trick**  
- In Round 1, the player holding the **3 of Clubs** (or lowest card unavailable) starts.  
- In later rounds, the **Scum** (last-place finisher) leads the first trick.

#### **Playing a Trick**  
1. The leader plays **1 to 4 cards of the same rank** (e.g., one 8, two Queens, three 4s).  
2. Each subsequent player, in clockwise order, may:  
   - **Play a stronger set** of the same size (e.g., respond to two 6s with two 9s or better), **or**  
   - **Play a higher-tier set** (e.g., respond to a single King with any pair), **or**  
   - **Pass** (and sit out the rest of the trick).  
3. When all remaining players pass in succession, the last player to play **wins the trick** and **leads the next one**.

> *Important: You may only play from your hand—you cannot draw new cards during a round.*

#### **Going Out**  
As soon as a player plays their **last card**, they are **out** and assigned a title based on elimination order:  
  - 1st: **President**  
  - 2nd: **Vice-President**  
  - 3rd: **Senator**
  - 4th: **Minister**
  - 5th: **Citizen**
  - ...
  - 2nd-to-last: **Peasant**
  - Last: **Scum**

If you want to make the game more fun, you may role-play as the character of the corresponding title. For example, the *President* may sit on the most comfy chair, while the *Scum* will sit on the most uncomfortable one, or even on the floor.

### **End of Round: Tribute & Scoring**  

#### **Tribute Phase**  
- The **Scum** gives their **two best cards** (by current rank) to the **President**.  
- The **President** gives back **any two cards** from their hand to the Scum.  
- In games with 4+ players:  
  - **Vice-Scum** gives **one card** to **Vice-President**, who returns **one card**.

> *Tribute occurs after every round except the very first.*

#### **Scoring**  
- **President**: +2 points  
- **Vice-President**: +1 point  
- All others: 0 points  
- First player to reach **10 points** wins the game.

### **Strategy Tips**  
- Make sure you can get rid of your lower-value cards; don't waste the best cards when there is a lot of action!
- If you have a *Revolution* in hand, make sure to get rid of your highest-rank cards first!
- When a player has few cards in hand, you can momentarily lock them out of play by playing combos bigger than their hand. Save the combos for the endgame!
