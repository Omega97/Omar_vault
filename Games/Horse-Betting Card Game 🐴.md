## Game Rules


### Requirements

- Two decks of 52 cards
- Tokens to keep track of the point

---

### Setup

- Take 2 decks of 52 cards each, and take 4 aces of different suits out first (they will be the **HORSES** of the **RACE**)
- One player is randomly chosen to be the **HOUSE** for the turn. The **HOUSE** is the player that "hosts the race" that turn.
- The house shuffles the deck, and deals 4 cards to each player

---

### Building the Track

- **RIGGING**: Starting from the player on the left of the **HOUSE** each player place a face-down card (🀄️) on the **TRACK** (*see picture below*)
- Then repeat this round of **RIGGING**, and place the deck at the end of the **TRACK**

_Example with 4 players:_

➕🀄️🀄️🀄️🀄️🀄️🀄️🀄️🀄️📚➕ <- TRACK
♥️
♦️
♣️
♠️

---

### Betting

- In the same order as before, one by one, each player reveals a card from the hand face-up on the table. They are **BETTING** on that **HORSE**

🔹 _Extra rule for flavour: The first time that any player bets first on a **HORSE** in each round, they get can choose the name of that **HORSE**. This makes the game twice as fun!_ 

---

### The Race

It's now time to make the **HORSES** race! The **HOUSE** runs the **RACE**.

- The **HORSES** are placed on the square before the first track card
- The **HOUSE** shows the top card of the deck, and moves the **HORSE** of the same suit one step forward
- Once all **HORSES** have travelled a certain number of squares, the according **TRACE** card is revealed (🎴), and the THORSE of the according suit has to move one square backward (if possible)
- The first **HORSE** to get out of the **TRACK**, wins the **RACE** (*see figure below*)
- Then, procede to the **pay-outs**, and the next player hosts the new race!

_Example with 4 players:_

### Pay-outs and Winning

- If no one bet on the right horse, the **HOUSE** wins +1🟡
- Otherwise, all the players who bet on the winner get +1🟡

Then, each player draws 3 cards.

The game ends after a player reaches a pre-determined number of points 🟡.
