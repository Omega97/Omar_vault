Below is the short checklist I hand to new Duelists before their first in-person event.  
(You already own the items that are **bolded**.)

### 1. Absolutely mandatory

| What                                                         | Why it matters                                                                                        | Where the rule comes from                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Deck (40–60)**, **Side Deck (0–15)** and **sleeves**  | Your cards must be tournament-legal and sleeved alike; bring the Side Deck even if you rarely use it. | Official Rulebook, p. 2 – 3 / Policy §G. Sleeves   |
| **Extra Deck (0–15)**                                        | Needed if you play Fusions, Synchros, Xyz, Links, etc. (counted separately from the Main Deck).       | Official Rulebook, p. 2 – 3                        |
| Completed **paper Deck List** (print or pick one up on site) | Every Constructed event collects these before round 1; judges use them for deck checks.               | Tournament Policy §D. Tournament Materials         |
| Pen + paper Life-Point sheet                                 | Life Points **must** be written; NEURON/calculators are only helpers, not the primary record.         | Tournament Policy §D & §E                          |
| **Dice** & **coins**                                         | For card effects that roll/flip.                                                                      | Official Rulebook, “Additional items you may need” |
| Monster **tokens** and **counters** that your deck produces  | If your strategy makes Tokens or uses counters, you must provide clear markers.                       | Official Rulebook, “Monster Tokens” & “Counters”   |
| Government photo ID + KONAMI CARD GAME ID (COSSY/NUM)        | Needed for registration and pairings; some venues also charge an entry fee.                           | Tournament Policy §D. Tournament Materials         |

### 2. Strongly recommended backups

- **Spare sleeves** (10–20) in the same colour: replace any that split mid-event.
    
- Extra signed Token cards or generic tokens for opponents who borrow them.
    
- A small **field-center card** or zone marker to keep Extra Monster Zones clear on shared mats.

### 3. Quality-of-life items

| Item                          | Use                                                                    |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NEURON app** (offline mode) | Quick LP math, coin flips, dice rolls, card scans—just mute the sound. |
| Pocket calculator             | Same purpose if you prefer buttons to touch screens.                   |
| Water bottle, snacks, jacket  | Rounds can run long; stay comfy and alert.                             |
| Trade binder / top-loader     | Optional, but handy between rounds.                                    |

### 4. Pre-event sanity checks

1. **Count your Main/Side/Extra one last time**; no card should be missing or double-sleeved.
    
2. Verify every card is **legal under the current Forbidden & Limited List**. (Print a copy or check in NEURON before you leave home.)
    
3. Shuffle in fresh sleeves if any show edge wear—judges will ask you to replace “marked” sleeves mid-round.
    
4. Pack everything in a sturdy **deck box** inside your bag so nothing slides out on the commute.
