Blow my mind... I was thinking about the most fundamental understanding we have about the Universe. It is my intuition, from what I read in literature, that, at a fundamental level, the Theory of Everything (ToE) should describe a specific type of discrete computation, in "space" and in time. I am talking about Wolfram's idea of *causal graphs* and the *space of computations*. In that regard, the Many Worlds interpretation of QM shows clear signs of this space, as the most *unique* property of QM is that there is no (local) hidden information, as it was brilliantly proved by Bell. It would seem as any *observer* (any coherent quantum system, really) lives in a superposition of identical reality "branches" from their point of view, and every interaction with a superposition, irreversibly separates them, based on the actual state of the *was* entangled system in **that** branch. The *ToE* just **has** to take that into account. 

But the quest for the fundamental, local rules of the computation we live in, is hard... Many layers of **emergence** need to be traversed, from the absolute smallest, the Planck length, to the familiar *manifold* that we call space-time, to a magnitude so big that the matter looks nothing more than a still and uniform layer of dust. 

In our search of fundamental beauty, we can't overlook the arguably most organic and beautiful branch of math; Group Theory . It shows up many times, not least, the *Standard Model* SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1), and in the *Exceptional simple Lie group E8*. There is a speculative, yet-to-prove link between it and the list of fundamental particles of nature. Also, the point-like treatment of the particles is obviously a crude approximation, as it doesn't match with the finiteness of the energy of the electron's field, or the fact that particles have *spin*, for example.

And how to forget the striking link between **posets** and *Relativity*, where events may not have a well-defined ordering. Then again, there are many unexplained phenomena; the expansion of the universe, from this perspective, could possibly be understood as a graph with an increasing number of nodes popping out uniformly throughout. The speed of information may be constant, but the number of steps (or links) to travel keeps increasing, with a net result that the geodesics are getting longer over time, and giving an explanation about the cosmic red-shift as well. What insight can you give me on this fascinating topic?


Other ideas:
- EM is due to the phase gauge in QM, and Noether's theorem 🤯
- a field in the multiverse is a superposition of individual particles, so when observing something, the observer in the individual strands differs, and thus they see only a particle
- Why do we have superposition at all? From which principles it may emerge? Which experiments demonstrate this better?
- Relativity shows in QM, suggesting that particles are very much related to the topology of spacetime
- Confined (massless) photons behave like a massive particle 🤯
- In AdS/CFT (holography), a quantum gravity theory in _d_-dimensions is equivalent to a quantum field theory _without gravity_ on its (_d_-1)-dimensional boundary. **Spacetime itself is a computational error-correcting code**—where entanglement entropy = geometric area (Ry-Takayanagi formula). Your "space of computations" is literally the boundary theory. 
- MWI + discrete computation implies **reality is a single quantum state evolving unitarily on a causal graph**. "Worlds" are emergent patterns in this state—not fundamental. The "space of computations" _is_ Hilbert space.
- In **topological quantum field theories (TQFTs)**, particles are **anyons**—quasiparticles whose braiding statistics are governed by _modular tensor categories_ (a generalization of group theory). This isn't just math: Google's quantum AI team is testing *anyons* for error-resistant qubits. **The universe may compute via topological invariants.**
- See "Are electrons made of light"?
- This must reproduce **inflation** and **dark energy**. In causal sets, Λ is predicted to be small but nonzero—matching observations. But we lack a first-principles derivation of the growth dynamics (yet to discover!)
- The Schrodinger equation is the Heat equation in imaginary time 🤯

#### Why does entropy increase?

At any moment, the representative point of a system is more likely to move towards a more likely micro-state. Therefore, an ordered initial configuration will tend towards equilibrium. 
While it's true that, in principle, by reversing the laws of motion we can decrease entropy, we are effectively picking an unlikely configuration, as most miro-states at equilibrium will usually stay such, as it's the most likely scenario. As we increase the number of variables in the system, these probabilistic arguments only become stronger.
