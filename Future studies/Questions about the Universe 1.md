Blow my mind... I was thinking about the most fundamental understanding we have about the Universe. 

It is my intuition, from what I read in literature, that, at a fundamental level, the Theory of Everything (ToE) should describe a specific type of discrete computation, in "space" and in time. I am talking about Wolfram's idea of the *space of computations*. In that regard, the Many Worlds interpretation of QM shows clear signs of this space, as the most *unique* property of QM is that there is no (local) hidden information, as it was brilliantly proved by Bell. It would seem as any *observer* (any coherent quantum system, really) lives in a superposition of identical reality "branches" from their point of view, and every interaction with a superposition, irreversibly separates them, based on the actual state of the *was* entangled system in **that** branch. The *ToE* just **has** to take that into account.

But the quest for the fundamental, local rules of the computation we live in is hard... Many layers of **emergence** need to be traversed, from the absolute smallest, the Planck length, to the familiar *manifold* that we call space-time, to a magnitude so big that the matter looks nothing more than a still and uniform layer of dust.

In our quest for fundamental beauty, we can't overlook the arguably most organic and beautiful branch of math; Group Theory. It shows up many times, not least, the *Exceptional simple Lie group E8*. There is a speculative, yet-to-prove link between it and the list of fundamental particles of nature. And how to forget the striking link between **posets** and *Relativity*, where events may not have a well-defined ordering.

Then again, there are many unexplained phenomena; the expansion of the universe, from this perspective, could possibly be understood as a graph with an increasing number of nodes popping out uniformly throughout. The speed of information may be constant, but the number of steps (or links) to travel keeps increasing, with a net result that the geodesics are getting longer over time, and giving an explanation about the cosmic red-shift as well.

What insight can you give me on this fascinating topic?
