A quantum-mechanical phenomenon in which an electrically charged particle is affected by an electromagnetic potential $(\phi, \displaystyle \mathbf {A})$, despite being confined to a region in which both the magnetic field $B$ and electric field $E$ are zero. The underlying mechanism is the coupling of the EM potential with the complex phase of a charged particle's wave function, and this effect is accordingly illustrated by interference experiments. 

[Holonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holonomy)
The holonomy of a connection on a smooth manifold is the extent to which parallel transport around closed loops fails to preserve the geometrical data being transported. Holonomy is a general geometrical consequence of the curvature of the connection. For flat connections, the associated holonomy is a type of monodromy and is an inherently global notion. For curved connections, holonomy has nontrivial local and global features.
