- 充電 = charge (battery)
- できる = can do / possible
- 場所 = place / location
- どこ = where
- ですか = question marker (polite)

5) **I deeply apologize.** 😭

$$\underbrace{申}_{もう}し\underbrace{訳}_{わけ}\quadありません。$$

- 申し訳 = apology, excuse
- ありません = there is not

💡 _This is a common and humble way to say "I'm truly sorry." While "owabi" (お詫び) is correct and used in formal apologies, it's usually part of longer phrases like "お詫びします." The most natural standalone apology is "申し訳ありません."_

- 販売機 = vending machine (generic term)  
- ありますか = is there?  

💡 **Note**: While **販売機** (*hanbaiki*) is technically correct, in everyday Japanese people almost always say **自動販売機** (*jidō hanbaiki*) for drink/snack vending machines. If you’re looking for a drink machine, it’s more natural to ask:
